This project is a checkpoint I built after learning React.

## Color Picker
I combined everything I learned from Codedex to create a simple **Color Picker**.  
- Hover over a color to see its hex code.  
- Click on a color to reveal its name.  
- Use the left and right arrow keys to cycle through different color names.
